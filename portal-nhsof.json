Admissions for cancer and obstetrics are excluded as they may be part of the patient\u2019s care plan.\n\nPurpose\n\nThis indicator aims to measure the success of the NHS in helping people to recover effectively from illnesses or injuries. If a person does not recover well, it is more likely that they will require hospital treatment again within the 30 days following their previous admission. Thus, readmissions are widely used as an indicator of the success of healthcare in helping people to recover.\n\nCurrent version updated: Feb-14\n\nNext version due: To be confirmed",

The aim is for incidence reporting to increase as the culture of reporting all incidents spreads more widely across the NHS. The ultimate goal is that the number of reported incidents remains steady or decreases, as the habit of reporting incidents becomes routine and these are learnt from.\n\nCurrent version updated: May-17\n\nNext version due: Nov-17",

This is because the PYLL from causes considered amenable to healthcare for all ages does not appear in the 2015/16 NHS Outcomes Framework. For Potential years of life lost (PYLL) from causes considered amenable to healthcare for adults or children and young people please see indicators 1a.i and 1a.ii.\n\nPurpose\n\nTo ensure that the NHS is held to account for doing all that it can to prevent amenable deaths. Deaths from causes considered \u2018amenable\u2019 to healthcare are premature deaths that should not occur in the presence of timely and effective healthcare.\n\nCurrent version updated: May-15\n\nNext version due: Will not be updated",
